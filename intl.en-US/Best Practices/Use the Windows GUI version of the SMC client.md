# Use the Windows GUI version of the SMC client {#concept_861889 .concept}

Alibaba Cloud provides a Windows GUI version of the SMC client to migrate Windows servers onto Alibaba Cloud. The settings available for the SMC client on the GUI are identical to those in the CLI. The Windows GUI version is compatible with the CLI version. This topic describes how to use the Windows GUI menu items in different migration modes.

## Daemon mode {#section_cno_ye6_d7w .section}

The following figure shows the Windows GUI in Daemon mode.

-   In Daemon mode, you only need to set **Access Id** and **Secret Key**. For more information about migration steps in Daemon mode, see [Migration process](../../../../reseller.en-US/User Guide/Migration process.md#).
-   You can choose **Config** \> **One-Time Job Mode** to switch to the one-time job mode. For more information, see [Menu items on the GUI](#section_vou_jqi_4db).

## One-time job mode {#section_2ak_fj4_r67 .section}

The following figure shows the Windows GUI in one-time job mode.

-   In one-time job mode, you must set **Access Id**, **Secret Key**, **Region Id**, **Image Name**, **Platform**, **System Disk Size**, and **Disk List**. For more information about how to attach disks, see [Menu items on the GUI](#section_vou_jqi_4db). For more information about migration steps in one-time job mode, see [Use the SMC client in one-time job mode](reseller.en-US/Best Practices/Use the SMC client in one-time job mode.md#).
-   You can clear **Config** \> **One-Time Job Mode** to switch to the Daemon mode.
