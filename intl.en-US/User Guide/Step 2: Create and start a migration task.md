# Step 2: Create and start a migration task {#task_827285 .task}

After migration source information is imported, the SMC console automatically generates a migration source record. You must create and start a migration task for the migration source in the console. This topic describes how to create and start a migration task.

-   Migration source information has been imported. For more information, see [Step 1: Import migration source information](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Step 1: Import migration source information.md#).
-   The migration source is in the Active state. If the migration source is in another state, a migration task cannot be created for the migration source. For more information about how to restore a migration source to the Active state, see [What do I do if I cannot create a migration task for a migration source in an inactive state?](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/SMC FAQ.md#section_weo_he3_b2a)

1.  Create a migration task. 
    1.  Log on to the SMC console.
    2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Migration Sources**.
    3.  Find the migration source that you want to migrate. 

        **Note:** You can obtain the migration source ID from the client interface as shown in the following figure, and find the migration source based on the ID. For more information about how to find a migration source, see [How do I find a migration source?](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/SMC FAQ.md#section_7hf_tn4_x5i)

    4.  Click **Create Migration Task**.
    5.  In the Create Migration Task dialog box that appears, set the migration task parameters. The following table describes the migration task parameters. 

        |Parameter|Required|Description|
        |:--------|:-------|:----------|
        |Target Region|Yes|The ID of the Alibaba Cloud region to which your source server will be migrated. For more information about Alibaba Cloud regions, see [Regions](../../../../reseller.en-US/General Reference/Regions and zones.md#section_ug5_k5k_xdb).|
        |Task Name|No|The name of the migration task. **Note:** The task name must be unique in an Alibaba Cloud region.

 |
        |Description|No|The description of the migration task.|
        |Target Disk \(GiB\)|Yes|**System Disk**: the system disk size of the target Alibaba Cloud ECS instance. Unit: GiB. The size of the target system disk must be greater than the actual used space of the system disk on the source server. For example, if the size of the source disk was 500 GiB but the actual used space was only 100 GiB, you would only need to set this parameter to a value greater than 100 GiB. **Note:** The default value is the size of the source system disk. If you do not need to reduce the size of the system disk, we recommend that you set this parameter to a value greater than or equal to the default value.

 |
        |No|**Data Disk**: the size of a data disk for the target Alibaba Cloud ECS instance. The size of the target data disk must be greater than the actual used space of the data disk on the source server. For example, if the size of the source disk was 500 GiB but the actual used space was only 100 GiB, you would only need to set this parameter to a value greater than 100 GiB. **Note:** If your migration source does not have a data disk or no data disk is attached, the **Data Disk** parameters will not be displayed. For more information, see [Why no data disk parameters are displayed in the Create Migration Task right-side pane? How can this problem be solved?](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/SMC FAQ.md#section_nt4_qfc_tev)

 |
        |Image Name|No|The name of the target Alibaba Cloud image generated by SMC for the migration source. **Note:** The image name must be unique in an Alibaba Cloud region.

 |
        |Method to Run|Yes|The method to run the migration task.         -   **Create Only**: creates but does not start the migration task. You must manually start the migration task.
        -   **Run Now**: creates and starts the migration task immediately.
        -   **Run Later**: creates the migration task and starts it at a specified time.

**Note:** The migration task must be scheduled at least 10 minutes after the creation time.

 Default value: Create Only

 |
        |Advanced Settings|No|**Transmission Speed Limit \(KB/s\)**: the maximum bandwidth of data transmission during migration. Unit: Kbit/s. The default value is 0, which indicates unlimited bandwidth.

 |
        |No|**Compression Rate**: the level of data compression during migration. Set the compression rate based on your actual needs.         -   If the bandwidth is limited, a high compression rate will improve the transmission efficiency.
        -   We recommend that you do not compress transmitted data if the bandwidth is high. This will reduce the CPU utilization of the migration source.
 The default value is 0, which indicates that transmitted data is not compressed.

 |
        |No|**Checksum Verification**: The checksum feature enhances the consistency of transmitted data at the expense of speed. By default, this feature is disabled.

    6.  Click **OK**.
2.  Start the migration task. 

    **Note:** If you set the Method to Run parameter to **Run Now** for the migration task, skip this step. If you set the Method to Run parameter to **Run Later** for the migration task, you can perform the following steps to manually start the migration task:

    1.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Migration Tasks**.
    2.  Find your migration task and click **Start**. 

        **Note:** 

        -   To start multiple migration tasks at a time, select the migration tasks that you want to start and click **Start/Retry**. The status of each migration task must be **Ready**, **Stopped**, or **InError**.
        -   Each intermediate instance creates a VPC. Each Alibaba Cloud account can have a maximum of 10 VPCs in a region, including your own VPCs and the VPCs created by intermediate instances. Therefore, the maximum number of migration sources you can migrate at a time cannot exceed 10. To raise the VPC quota, [submit a ticket](https://workorder.console.aliyun.com/#/ticket/list/).
        -   To stop a migration task in the **Syncing** state, click **Stop** in the **Actions** column.

-   On the Migration Tasks page, wait for the task to complete. When the status is **Finished**, the migration succeeded. You can then perform the following operations:
    1.  Click the image link in the **Migration Result** column. On the Images page that appears, find the generated custom image.
    2.  Use this custom image to create a pay-as-you-go ECS instance or replace the system disk to test whether the custom image runs properly. For more information about how to use a custom image to create an instance, see [../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_2/DNECS19100341/EN-US\_TP\_9627.md\#](../../../../reseller.en-US/Instances/Create an instance/Create an instance by using a custom image.md#). For more information about how to replace a system disk, see [Replace the system disk \(non-public image\)](../../../../reseller.en-US/Block Storage/Block storage/Change the operating system/Replace the system disk (non-public image).md#).

        **Note:** You can use a custom image without data disks to replace the system disk of the instance.

    3.  Remotely connect to the instance and check the migrated system. For more information, see [How can I check my system after migrating a Windows server?](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/SMC FAQ.md#section_c5i_33t_xn7) or [How can I check my system after migrating a Linux server?](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/SMC FAQ.md#section_8nx_71l_ksv)
-   When the migration task is in the **InError** state, the migration failed. In this case, you must perform the following operations:
    1.  Click **View Log** in the **Actions** column corresponding to the migration task. For more information about common errors and solutions, see [SMC FAQ](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/SMC FAQ.md#).
    2.  On the Migration Tasks page, restart the migration task. The migration task will resume from where the last migration left off.

        **Note:** If the intermediate instance has been released, a new migration is required. For more information, see [What do I do if I released an intermediate instance by mistake?](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/SMC FAQ.md#section_1nu_xd1_bip)
