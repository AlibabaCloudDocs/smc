SMC is provided free of charge. However, some Alibaba Cloud ECS resources created during migration will incur fees charged to your account.

During migration, the ECS resources created by SMC under your Alibaba Cloud account and their billing methods are as follows:

-   Intermediate instances: pay-as-you-go. For more information, see [Pay-As-You-Go](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pay-As-You-Go.md#).
-   Cloud disks attached to intermediate instances: pay-as-you-go. For more information, see [Pay-As-You-Go](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Pay-As-You-Go.md#).
-   Custom images: free of charge.

**Note:** If a migration task fails or is stopped but it is [not expired](../../../../reseller.en-US/FAQ/SMC FAQ.md#section_oe7_6bl_vu6), its intermediate instance will be retained along with the task for a period of time and incur fees. If you do not need to continue the migration task, you can delete the task to clear the intermediate instance and avoid incurring fees.
