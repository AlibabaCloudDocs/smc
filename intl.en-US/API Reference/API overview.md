# API overview {#concept_593234 .concept}

A wide range of API operations are available with SMC. If you are familiar with network service protocols and more than one programming language, we recommend that you use the SMC API to migrate source servers to Alibaba Cloud.

## Limits {#section_nxc_3tq_9rx .section}

There are limits on the number of migration sources that can be imported as well as the number of migration tasks that can be created or concurrently executed. For more information, see [Limits](../../../../reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Limits.md#). When API descriptions, optional parameter values, and available specifications are not consistent with the limits, the limits take precedence.

## Instructions {#section_orn_ttm_50z .section}

This service supports HTTP and HTTPS requests as well as GET and POST methods. For more information about how to call the SMC API, see [Make API requests](reseller.en-US/API Reference/Make API requests.md#).

Alibaba Cloud provides a quick start guide for the SMC API. For more information, see [Quick start](reseller.en-US/API Reference/Quick start.md#). For more information about the SMC API, see [List of operations by function](reseller.en-US/API Reference/List of operations by function.md#).
